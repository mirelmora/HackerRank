# Consider two points p=(px, py), and q=(qx, qy). We consider the inversion or point reflection, r=(rx,ry), of point p
# across point q to be a 180  rotation of point p around q.
# Given n  sets of points p and q , find r for each pair of points and print two space-separated integers denoting
# the respective values of rx and ry  on a new line.
